About the model 

Brief :
This model is agent-based model (ABM) creating model in an environment and make them interact with each other based on predefined conditions.
Elements: 
This model is consisting of four main files. 
-	The model (FinalModel.py) which has the all model script 
-	The framework (agentframework.py) which has the agent class defining the agent’s behavior and this file is very important to run the model. 
-	Web file where the agent’s coordinates are defined 
-	Csv file which define the environment where the agents are act.

Model purpose: 
This model is creating agents and plotting them in an environment based on predefined coordinates in web file. Then the agent start moving in the environment, eating from the it and sharing the store with its neighbors.al that based on conditions defined in the model.

Way to run the model: 
Geographical User Interface is used in this model, once you run the model it is expected that a window will be opened. In that window a menu bar is created has on menu called model. By pressing on that menu one option will appear called run model. That function will make the model run and the agent will be moving and eating based on the conditions.
